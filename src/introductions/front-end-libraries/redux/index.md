## Introduction to the Redux Challenges

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. 

Managing applications with complex state logic is hard, especially when you have components rendering based on states of other components. Yet the demands for single-page applications are ever increasing. Libraries like React aim to solve complexities that arise from mutation and asynchronicity in the view layer by removing both asynchrony and direct DOM manipulation. But they don't solve state management. Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. These restrictions are reflected in the core principles of Redux.

While you can use Redux with any view library, it's introduced here before being combined with React.

## Introduction to the Front End Libraries Projects
Time to put your new skills to work! These projects will allow you to apply skills you have learnt so far. You should use frontend framework (React) and preprocessor (SCSS) to get some practice with them.

In this section you will:
* Build a Random Quote Machine
* Build a Markdown Previewer
* Build a Drum Machine
* Build a JavaScript Calculator
* Build a Pomodoro Clock

By the end of this, you would have 5 front-end applications in your portfolio. Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) method if you get stuck.

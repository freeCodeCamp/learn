## Introduction to the Front End Libraries Projects

Now that you have studied and practiced so many front-end libraries, it is time you put this knowledge to use and create real world like projects with your newly gained knowledge. Hope you will find these projects interesting and challenging enough. And as you know, you can reach out to the forum for any problem you come across during any of these projects. People here love helping others.

### Note: All the projects have some use cases that you need to fulfill in order to pass the test cases

Help us make it real on [GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/learn/tree/master/src/introductions).

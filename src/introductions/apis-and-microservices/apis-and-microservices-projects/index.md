## Introduction to the APIs and Microservices Projects

Time to put your newly learnt skills to work! By working on projects you would have the opportunity to apply your knowledge of APIs and Microservices.

In this section you get the chance to build:
 * Timestamp Microservice
 * Request Header Parser Microservice
 * URL Shortener Microservice
 * Exercise Tracker
 * File Metadata Microservice

Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) method if you get stuck.

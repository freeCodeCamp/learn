## Introduction to the APIs and Microservices Projects

Time to put your newly learnt skills to work! By working on projects you would have the opportunity of applying all the skills, principles and concepts you have learnt so far including npm packages, basic Node, basic Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

In this section you get the chance to:
 * Build a Timestamp Microservice
 * Build a Request Header Parser Microservice
 * Build a URL Shortener Microservice
 * Build a Exercise Tracker
 * Build a File Metadata Microservice

By the end of this, you would have 5 microservices under your belt that you can show off to friends, family, employers, etc. Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) method if you get stuck.

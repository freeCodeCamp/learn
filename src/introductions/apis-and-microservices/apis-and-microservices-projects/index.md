## Introduction to the APIs and Microservices Projects

APIs are Application Programming Interfaces that are used to communicate between several software components and applications. And several web services are used to make such request to software applications using web protocols like SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST(Representational State Transfer).<br><br>REST uses different HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PATCH, PUT and DELETE.<br><br>GET is used to get resources, POST is used to create a document or resource, PATCH is used to partially update a document or resource, PUT is used to update a document and DELETE is an HTTP verb used to delete a document or resource. Communication can be made between Software applications using JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)<br><br>Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
<br><br>A basic API would involve performing CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using HTTP verbs and JSON as data type and can also be broken down into microservices.
Working on these challenges will involve you writing your code on Glitch on our starter project. After completing each challenge you can copy your public Glitch url (to the homepage of your app) into the challenge screen to test it! Optionally you may choose to write your project on another platform but it must be publicly visible for our testing.<br>Start this project on Glitch using <a href='https://glitch.com/#!/import/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm'>this link</a> or clone <a href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm/'>this repository</a> on GitHub! If you use Glitch, remember to save the link to your project somewhere safe!

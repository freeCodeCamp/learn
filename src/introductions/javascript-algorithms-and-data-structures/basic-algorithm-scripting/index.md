## Introduction to Basic Algorithm Scripting

Algorithms is the process used to solve problems, this process first include understanding the problem and then solve it with coding. We solve problems by dividing them in to many chunks and then solving each chunk one by one. For example if we have to build a calculator then instead of thinking about the problem as a whole we first consider how to take inputs, then consider each arithematic operation one by one and then finally we will display the results.

In this lesson we will learn to solve the very basic algorithm problems using JavaScript which will help you to improve your problem solving skills and in future it will help you to jump into the complex problems. First part is always to fully understand the problem and then after that solve each chunk one by one.

#### Note
Use `console.log()` to debug whenever you feel stuck in the process of solving the problem.

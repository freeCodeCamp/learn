## Introduction to the Data Visualization Projects

These challenges let you test your data visualzation skills and how to transfer and use data using AJAX technologies.

In this section you get the chance to:
 * Visualize Data with a Bar Chart
 * Not PassedVisualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph
 * Not PassedVisualize Data with a Heat Map
 * Not PassedVisualize Data with a Choropleth Map
 * Not PassedVisualize Data with a Treemap Diagram

By the end of this, you would have 5 projects to showcase your data visualization skills that you can show off to friends, family, employers, etc. Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) method if you get stuck.
